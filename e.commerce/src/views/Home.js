                         <p>In collaboration with Jacob & Co. Bugatti embarks into a new era: the partnership between the French manufacturer of hyper-sportscars Bugatti and the New York & Geneva-based, leading supplier of highly complex timepieces Jacob & Co. not only unites two companies that have always valued innovative design, but who have passionately expanded the boundaries of what is mechanically possible. Now both pioneers will create a range of exclusive Bugatti branded products together. Jacob Arabov, founder of Jacob & Co., compares the sensation aroused by his sophisticated timepieces with the same adrenaline rush that is unleashed by the mere sight of the Bugatti Chiron: a feeling of energy, movement and strength that is almost impossible to hold back.</p>

                                <p className="">Limited to just 110 examples, this special edition "Bugatti Chrono Edition Limit√©e 110 Ans" commemorates the founding of Bugatti by Ettore Bugatti in 1909.
